# Libraries Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib & Seaborn)

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis involved performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover valuable insights from the marketing campaign data. Key steps in the EDA process included:

* **Pandas**: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregating important metrics such as conversion rates, customer acquisition costs, and return on investment (ROI).

* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Employed for visualizing trends, identifying correlations, and assessing geographic performance through time-series plots, heatmaps, and distribution charts.

# Recommendations

* **Refine Targeting**:
Focus on improving targeting strategies to reduce acquisition costs, especially for segments with higher ROI. Additionally, consider extending the duration of campaigns to maximize returns, especially in months showing high engagement but lower conversion rates (April and July), allowing more time to nurture potential leads into customers.

* **Enhance Localization**:
Continue successful localization efforts for non-English-speaking markets while refining content to improve conversion efficiency across all languages.

* **Focus on High-Impact Channels**:
Social media, especially influencer marketing, should remain a priority due to its high engagement and ROI, but don’t neglect email, which offers consistent returns with lower acquisition costs.

This analysis provides a clear pathway to optimize marketing efforts across channels, audiences, and geographies, helping the company drive greater ROI and sustained growth.
